# HC\_SR04A simple class for an HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor, primarily for use with Arduinos.# Description## HC\_SR04( _trigPin_, _echoPin_, _delay_ )Creates an HC_SR04 object (constructor).### _Arguments_* uint8_t _trigPin_: number of the pin connected to the trigger.* uint8_t _echoPin_: number of the pin where the echo delay comes back on.* unsigned long _delay_: the delay, in milliseconds, to wait for the echo. Default is 1000 ms.## void setDelay( _delay_ )Sets a new delay for listening for the echo.### _Arguments_* unsigned long _delay_: delay in milliseconds.## unsigned long inches()Returns distanced measured by the ultrasonic sensor in inches. If no echo was received in the _delay_ time, then (unsigned long) -1 is returned.## unsigned long centimeters()Returns distanced measured by the ultrasonic sensor in centimeters. If no echo was received in the _delay_ time, then (unsigned long) -1 is returned.
